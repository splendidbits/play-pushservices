# Router
# ~~~~~
# Define the Router object to use for this application.
# This router will be looked up first when the application is starting up,
# so make sure this is the entry point.
# Furthermore, it's assumed your mRoute file is named properly.
# So for an application router like `my.application.Router`,
# you may need to define a router file `conf/my.application.routesdel`.
# Default to Routes in the root package (and conf/routesdel)
# play.http.router = my.application.Routes
